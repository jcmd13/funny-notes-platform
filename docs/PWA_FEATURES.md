- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of sync failures with retry mechanisms

### 3. App Installation

- **Install Prompts**: Smart prompts appear after user engagement
- **Installation Detection**: Detects when app is already installed
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on desktop, mobile, and tablet devices
- **Installation Benefits**: Highlighted benefits (offline access, performance, etc.)

### 4. Offline Indicators

   - Handles installation prompts and updates
   - Coordinates background sync operations

2. **usePWA Hook** (`src/hooks/usePWA.ts`)
   - React hook for PWA functionality
   - Provides state and actions to components
   - Manages subscriptions to PWA events

3. **PWA UI Components**
   - `PWAInstallPrompt`: Installation prompt modal
   - `PWAStatusManager`: Handles status notifications
   - Enhanced Header with status indicators

### Configuration

- **Vite PWA Plugin**: Advanced Workbox configuration

2. **Offline Use**: Continue using the app even without internet
3. **Sync Status**: Watch for sync indicators in the header
4. **Updates**: Click update icon when new versions are available

### For Developers

1. **PWA State**: Use the `usePWA()` hook to access PWA functionality
2. **Status Notifications**: PWA status changes trigger automatic toast notifications
3. **Background Sync**: Offline changes are automatically queued and synced
4. **Testing**: PWA functionality works in development mode

## Browser Support

- **Chrome/Edge**: Full PWA support including installation
- **Firefox**: Core PWA features, limited installation support
- **Safari**: iOS PWA support with home screen installation
- **Mobile Browsers**: Full mobile PWA experience

## Future Enhancements

4. **Background Updates**: Automatic content updates in background

## Testing PWA Features

### Development Testing

```bash
# Start development server with PWA enabled
npm run dev

# Build and preview production PWA
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### Browser Testing

1. Open Chrome DevTools → Application → Service Workers
2. Check "Offline" to test offline functionality
3. Use "Application" → "Manifest" to test installation
4. Monitor "Network" tab for caching behavior

### Mobile Testing

1. Open app in mobile browser
2. Look for "Add to Home Screen" prompt
3. Test offline functionality by disabling network
4. Verify splash screen and icon appearance

## Performance Impact

- **Bundle Size**: ~5KB additional for PWA functionality
- **Runtime Overhead**: Minimal impact on app performance
- **Cache Benefits**: Faster loading after initial visit
- **Offline Benefits**: Zero network dependency for core features

## Security Considerations

- **HTTPS Required**: PWA features require secure context
- **Service Worker Scope**: Limited to app origin
- **Permission Model**: User consent required for notifications
- **Data Privacy**: Offline data stored locally only
