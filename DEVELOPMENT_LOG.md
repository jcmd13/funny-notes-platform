### ‚úÖ Task 8: Fix Note Model and Components Integration
**Completed:** January 10, 2025  
**Status:** COMPLETED

#### Changes Made:
1. **Note Model Restructure (`src/core/models/Note.ts`)**
   - Renamed `type` field to `captureMethod` for better clarity
   - Added optional fields: `venue`, `audience`, `estimatedDuration`
   - Made `tags` field have default empty array
   - Updated Zod schema validation

2. **Database Migration (`src/core/storage/IndexedDBAdapter.ts`)**
   - Added IndexedDB version 2 migration
   - Migrates existing `type` field to `captureMethod`
   - Initializes new optional fields for existing records

3. **Component Updates:**
   - **TextCapture** (`src/components/capture/TextCapture.tsx`): Updated to use `captureMethod` and `estimatedDuration`
   - **NoteCard** (`src/components/notes/NoteCard.tsx`): Fixed TypeScript imports and field references
   - **NoteEditor** (`src/components/notes/NoteEditor.tsx`): Updated to handle new fields and correct updateNote signature
   - **NoteList** (`src/components/notes/NoteList.tsx`): Fixed filtering and sorting logic
   - **NotesFilter** (`src/components/notes/NotesFilter.tsx`): Updated Button variants and CaptureMethod import
   - **NotePreview** (`src/components/capture/NotePreview.tsx`): Updated field references
   - **ActivityTimeline** (`src/components/dashboard/ActivityTimeline.tsx`): Fixed field reference

4. **Storage Service Updates (`src/core/storage/StorageService.ts`)**
   - Updated createNote and createManyNotes to handle new fields
   - Changed listNotes options to use `captureMethod` instead of `type`

5. **Hook Updates (`src/hooks/useNotes.ts`)**
   - Updated UseNotesOptions interface to use `captureMethod`

6. **Utility Updates (`src/core/utils/modelUtils.ts`)**
   - Updated createNote function to use `captureMethod` parameter

#### Issues Resolved:
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation errors in main application
- ‚úÖ Component prop type mismatches
- ‚úÖ Database schema compatibility
- ‚úÖ Import/export conflicts with CaptureMethod type
- ‚úÖ Button variant naming issues
- ‚úÖ Function signature mismatches

#### Technical Debt:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Test files still need updating (deferred to future cleanup)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some test files reference old `type` field
