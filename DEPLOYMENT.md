# Deployment Guide

This document provides comprehensive instructions for deploying Funny Notes to various hosting platforms.

## Build Optimization Summary

The application has been optimized for production with the following features:

### âœ… Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
- **Route-based code splitting**: Each page is lazy-loaded as a separate chunk
- **Vendor chunking**: Dependencies are split into logical chunks (React, UI libraries, etc.)
- **Dynamic imports**: Heavy dependencies like Tesseract.js are loaded on-demand
- **Bundle analysis**: Current build produces ~870KB JS and ~63KB CSS (well within performance budgets)

### âœ… Performance Optimizations
- **Tree shaking**: Unused code is automatically removed
- **Minification**: Production builds use Terser for optimal compression
- **Asset optimization**: Images and fonts are optimized and cached
- **Service Worker**: Comprehensive caching strategy for offline functionality

### âœ… PWA Features
- **Manifest**: Valid PWA manifest with proper icons and metadata
- **Service Worker**: Workbox-powered SW with background sync and caching
- **Offline Support**: Full functionality available offline
- **Install Prompts**: Native app-like installation experience

### 3. GitHub Pages

Free hosting directly from your GitHub repository.

#### Setup
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Enable GitHub Actions (workflow is already configured)
3. Go to Settings > Pages
4. Select "GitHub Actions" as source
5. The site will deploy automatically on push to main

#### Custom Domain
To use a custom domain:
1. Add your domain to the `cname` field in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
2. Configure DNS to point to GitHub Pages

### 4. Firebase Hosting

Google's hosting platform with excellent performance and CDN.

#### Setup
1. Install Firebase CLI: `npm i -g firebase-tools`
2. Login: `firebase login`
3. Initialize: `firebase init hosting`
4. Build: `npm run build`
5. Deploy: `firebase deploy`

#### Configuration
Create `firebase.json`:
```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "dist",
    "ignore": ["firebase.json", "**/.*", "**/node_modules/**"],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ],
    "headers": [
      {
        "source": "/sw.js",
        "headers": [
          {
            "key": "Cache-Control",
            "value": "no-cache"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Build Validation

Before deploying, always validate your build:

```bash
npm run build:validate
```

This script checks:
- âœ… All required files are present
- âœ… PWA manifest is valid
- âœ… Code splitting is working
- âœ… Bundle sizes are within limits
- âœ… Service Worker is generated

## Performance Monitoring

The application includes built-in performance monitoring:

### Core Web Vitals
- **FCP (First Contentful Paint)**: < 2s
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: < 2.5s
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: < 0.1
- **FID (First Input Delay)**: < 100ms

### Bundle Size Limits
- **JavaScript**: < 1MB total
- **CSS**: < 100KB total
- **Individual chunks**: < 250KB each

## Environment Variables

For production deployments, you may need to set:

```bash
# Optional: Analytics tracking
VITE_ANALYTICS_ID=your-analytics-id

# Optional: Error reporting
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=your-sentry-dsn

# Optional: Feature flags
VITE_ENABLE_BETA_FEATURES=false
```

## Security Considerations

The application includes security headers:
- **CSP**: Content Security Policy
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security
- **X-Frame-Options**: Clickjacking protection
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: MIME sniffing protection

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
1. Clear node_modules: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json`
2. Reinstall: `npm install`
3. Try building: `npm run build`

### Service Worker Issues
1. Clear browser cache completely
2. Check browser dev tools > Application > Service Workers
3. Unregister old service workers if needed

### Performance Issues
1. Run bundle analysis: `npm run build:analyze`
2. Check for large dependencies
3. Ensure code splitting is working

### PWA Installation Issues
1. Verify HTTPS is enabled
2. Check manifest.webmanifest is accessible
3. Ensure service worker is registered

## Monitoring & Analytics

Consider adding:
- **Google Analytics 4**: User behavior tracking
- **Sentry**: Error monitoring and performance
- **Lighthouse CI**: Automated performance testing
- **Web Vitals**: Core Web Vitals monitoring

## Continuous Deployment

The GitHub Actions workflow automatically:
1. Runs tests on every PR
2. Builds and validates the application
3. Deploys to GitHub Pages on main branch
4. Runs E2E tests against the deployed site

## Support

For deployment issues:
1. Check the build validation output
2. Review browser console for errors
3. Verify all environment variables are set
4. Test the build locally with `npm run preview`
