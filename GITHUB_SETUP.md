# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Quick Setup (Manual)

Since the GitHub API had authentication issues, here's how to set up your repository manually:

### 1. Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/new)
2. Repository name: `funny-notes-platform`
3. Description: `A comedy material management platform for stand-up comedians - built with React, TypeScript, and PWA features`
4. Make it **Public** (or Private if you prefer)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (you already have code)
6. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Connect Your Local Repository
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Run these in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with jcmd13)
git remote add origin https://github.com/jcmd13/funny-notes-platform.git

# Push your existing code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify Setup
After pushing, you should see all your code on GitHub at:
`https://github.com/jcmd13/funny-notes-platform`

## Automated Workflow (Using Kiro Hooks)

Once your repository is set up, you can use these Kiro hooks for automated workflows:

### ðŸ”„ GitHub Sync Workflow
- **Hook**: `github-sync-workflow.kiro.hook`
- **Purpose**: Complete workflow for committing and syncing changes
- **Use when**: You want a guided workflow with explanations

### ðŸ“¤ Commit & Push Changes  
- **Hook**: `commit-and-push.kiro.hook`
- **Purpose**: Quick commit and push for development changes
- **Use when**: You want to quickly save and sync your work

### ðŸ“‹ Create GitHub Issues from Tasks
- **Hook**: `create-github-issues.kiro.hook`
- **Purpose**: Convert your task list into GitHub issues for project management
- **Use when**: You want to track tasks as GitHub issues

## Using the Hooks

1. Open the Command Palette in Kiro (Cmd+Shift+P)
2. Search for "Open Kiro Hook UI" or find the hook in the Explorer
3. Click on any of the hooks above to run them

## MCP Docker GitHub Tools

Your MCP configuration is working! You have access to these GitHub tools:
- Create/update repositories
- Manage issues and pull requests  
- Create branches and commits
- Search repositories and users
- And much more!

## Next Steps

1. Set up the repository manually (steps 1-2 above)
2. Use the "Commit & Push Changes" hook for regular development
3. Use the "Create GitHub Issues from Tasks" hook to set up project management
4. Continue development using the task list in `.kiro/specs/funny-notes-platform/tasks.md`

Your Funny Notes platform is ready for collaborative development! ðŸŽ¤âœ¨
