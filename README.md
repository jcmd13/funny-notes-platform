â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/          # Custom React hooks
â””â”€â”€ utils/          # Utility functions
```

## Architecture

The app follows a layered architecture with platform-agnostic core logic that can be reused across web and native platforms:

- **Core Layer**: Pure TypeScript business logic
- **Storage Layer**: Abstracted storage interface with IndexedDB implementation
- **UI Layer**: React components consuming core services
- **PWA Layer**: Service worker and offline capabilities

This design enables future expansion to React Native or native apps while reusing 80% of the codebase.
